⭐ PART 4 — HOW TO STAY FOCUSED AS A SOLO DEVELOPER
1. Follow the “No New Tools Rule”

Once you choose:

Next.js

Prisma

Tailwind

Stripe

Socket.IO

… you cannot watch tutorials about other stacks.
This protects your brain from distractions.

Keep your tech stack fixed.

2. Use the 80/20 rule

80% of your progress comes from 20% of features.
Your goal is to finish the MVP first, then polish.

MVP includes:

Auth

Profile

Match

Message

Search

Subscribe

Everything else is optional at the start.

3. Don’t try to make it perfect

Get it working, not perfect.

You can optimize later.

4. Limit tutorial time

Max 15–20 minutes of tutorials per day.
More than that = procrastination disguised as productivity.

5. Push to GitHub DAILY

Even if you wrote 5 lines.
This keeps momentum.

6. Use micro-tasks

Never start your next day with a blank mind.

Every night, create 3–5 tasks like:

Create Profile model in Prisma

Add profile update API

Build simple profile form

You wake up already knowing what to do.

7. Keep a “Done List”

Every completed task goes into a DONE list.
Seeing progress keeps you motivated and reduces burnout.
